The program Geometry was developed based on a UML Class Diagram, which provides a visual representation of the classes and their relationships.

Geometry.py defines a Geometry class that demonstrates geometric shapes by creating two Rectangle and two Square objects, imported from Rectangle.py and Square.py projects.

It stores these objects in a list, displays their properties using getter methods, and calculates their areas and perimeters, demonstrating polymorphism.

The program accesses the external classes through imports, enabling organised and reusable code.
