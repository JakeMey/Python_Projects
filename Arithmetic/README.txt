The Arithmetic program defines an arithmetic class that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

It continuously prompts the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operation, validating the inputs to ensure they are correct.

If the user enters invalid data, such as non-numeric values or invalid operations, the program provides error messages and prompts for input again.
